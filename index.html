                <p>The future of spaceflight will be built in space, not launched from Earth.</p>

                        In-space manufacturing is crucial for sustainable long-term space activities:
                        launching mass from Earth is prohibitively expensive. Orbital production
                        platforms are essential both to gather real process data today and to
                        produce goods in relevant quantities tomorrow. The first such facilities
                        will be realised in Low Earth Orbit – and Starlab is a key stepping stone.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Aboard Starlab, the proposed <strong>StarForge</strong> platform will
                        demonstrate and evaluate laser-based sintering, melting, and cutting
                        processes. It targets metallurgy, polymer and in-space manufacturing research,
                        while also serving as a crew support system capable of producing custom
                        hardware on demand.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        By fabricating objects directly from digital inputs, StarForge also opens
                        up powerful opportunities for public outreach and education, providing a
                        safe and engaging interface between citizens and space activities.

                        StarForge relies on mature, well-established components extensively
                        validated under terrestrial conditions: high-power fibre lasers,
                        beam delivery and scanning optics, powder recycling systems,
                        AI-based defect detection, and dust containment and filtration
                        units. These subsystems form a robust foundation for adapting
                        the architecture to microgravity.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Additive manufacturing in space has already been demonstrated
                        aboard the ISS, starting with polymers and advancing towards
                        metals and regolith-based materials. Most systems use
                        filament-based extrusion, simplifying material handling but
                        limiting geometric precision and material flexibility.

                    <h3>StarForge’s Advance</h3>
                    <p>
                        StarForge pursues a <strong>powder-based laser approach</strong>
                        that offers:
                    </p>
                    <ul class="checklist">
                        <li>Higher precision and structural complexity</li>
                        <li>Support for metals and regolith simulants</li>
                        <li>Integrated additive & subtractive processing</li>
                        <li>In-situ recycling of produced parts</li>

                    </ul>
                    <p>
                        A fully integrated system combining manufacturing and
                        recycling is a novel step towards industrial-grade orbital
                        infrastructure.

                    <h3>Customers & Revenue Streams</h3>
                    <p>
                        StarForge targets both upstream and downstream applications,
                        opening multiple revenue streams while addressing critical needs
                        for Starlab and future orbital platforms.
                    </p>
                    <ul>
                        <li>Space agencies and research institutions: material studies and process data</li>
                        <li>Private companies: custom material samples and structural components</li>
                        <li>Crew support: in-orbit production of custom hardware and spare parts</li>
                    </ul>
                    <p>
                        Reducing crew involvement is key to keeping operations cost-effective.
                        AI-based fault detection and remote monitoring allow autonomous
                        operation, with crew only intervening for sample retrieval or
                        exceptional maintenance.

                    <h3>Circular & Scalable</h3>
                    <p>
                        A central differentiator is StarForge’s emphasis on circularity:
                        internal recycling significantly reduces or eliminates the need
                        for consumable replenishment.
                    </p>
                    <ul>
                        <li>
                            Closed-loop business model where internal recycling makes power
                            consumption the main cost driver.
                        </li>
                        <li>
                            For open use cases (where parts leave the system), pricing
                            reflects feedstock resupply costs.
                        </li>
                        <li>
                            Future capability to convert packaging waste or polymers into
                            usable feedstock.

                    <p>
                        No known competitor currently targets this segment. While many
                        in-space manufacturing efforts focus on high-value, low-mass
                        products (pharma, semiconductors), StarForge pioneers functional
                        and structural manufacturing with in-situ utility and logistical
                        sustainability – as a first mover in a critical domain.
